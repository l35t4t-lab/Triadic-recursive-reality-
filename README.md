# Triadic Recursive Reality

A conceptual and experimental framework for exploring **triadic recursive lattices** inspired by fractal reality and lattice-based emergent systems.

This repository provides a Python prototype for simulating **Observer ↔ Field ↔ System-State** interactions, recursive feedback loops, and emergent stability across multi-layer networks.

## Features

- Triadic recursive lattice architecture
- Configurable depth and branching factor
- Recursive propagation of influence
- Visualization of node states
- Modular design for extension and experimentation

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Triadic-Recursive-Reality.git
cd Triadic-Recursive-Reality
pip install -r requirements.txt
